# Map671---Final
This repository includes my final interactive map, backstory, README, etc.

Background: 
Interactive maps are useful tools that assist the viewer in a more comprehensive and captivating way. The data from this interactive map is sourced through local government data and initial base data provided via Mapbox. Louisville Metro notes that, "This dataset consists of gun violence within Jefferson county that may fall within LMPDs radar, including non-fatal shootings, homicides, as well as shot-spotter data. The mapping data points where there are victims have been obfuscated to maintain privacy, while still being accurate enough to be placed in its correct boundaries, particularly around, neighborhoods, ZIP Codes, Council districts, and police divisions." https://data.louisvilleky.gov/datasets/d34cb284633741ca994ccf92b8333202/about 

Purpose: 
While this map has concerning points, it is very much a reality for the community. When I taught there, it was a localized experience for many students. Also, the main reason why the points are red is to honor grass-roots organizations like No More Red Dots - https://no-more-red-dots.odoo.com/services. I have had the pleasure of volunteering my time to support this cause.

Data Source:
1. gun-violence-data-82uoeh (Louisville Metro Open Data)
2. building-extrusion (Mapbox)
3. water 1 (Mapbox)
4. place labels (Mapbox)
5. point of interest labels (Mapbox)
6. natural features (Mapbox)
7. transit (Mapbox)

Map Creation: 
This map was created by developing a base 3D layer of the city of Louisville, and then applying the gun violence layer overtop. It is fairly simple but some codes had to be edited in Visual Studio Code.
